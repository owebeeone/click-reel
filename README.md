# click-reel

A React library for creating screenshot animations of UI interactions.

## Development

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The dev server uses `src/App.jsx` as a playground for testing the library components from `src/lib`.

## Building the Library

To build the library for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the distributable files in the `dist` folder.
